# Bourbon-Chef
### A Bourbon, Bitters, Neat and Refills Based Web App Build System

#### About
The Bourbon-Chef workflow is based on some experimenting I did in the [underscores-boilerplate](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/underscores-boilerplate/wiki) repository.  Much of the content in that wiki pertains to the use of WordPress and its Underscores theme.  As I started working on [Surfing-Chef-4.0](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/underscores-boilerplate/tree/Surfing-Chef-4.0), I realized that Bourbon and and its various ingredients allowed for a great build system.  

The mixin library that is **[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)** combines with the grid framework of **[Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)** to give Bourbon-Chef its *Sass-y* flexibility. Adding **[Bitters'](http://bitters.bourbon.io/)** scaffold styles, variables and structure gives a consistant feel to the project, while **[Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/)** contributes reliable components and patterns built with both **Bourbon** and **Neat**.  The Gulp toolkit automates **Bourbon-Chef's** ingredients, allowing for a front end development workflow focused more on design and content. 

#### Installation and Setup
- A few assumptions: basic knowledge of Git and Github, CSS, SASS, Gulp, and the command terminal
- Bourbon-Chef requires that [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) is installed on your machine.  Setup [Ruby, Sass and Bourbon](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/Bourbon/wiki/Ruby-and-Bourbon).
- Bourbon-Chef also requires that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), more specifically NPM (node package manager)is installed on your machine to load packages for Gulp - ensure the [latest version](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/Bourbon/wiki/Latest-Node.js-and-Gulp) is installed on your machine.  
- Once Gulp is installed globally, set up a [package.json](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/Bourbon/wiki/package.json) and install Gulp into your project


#### Version Control
